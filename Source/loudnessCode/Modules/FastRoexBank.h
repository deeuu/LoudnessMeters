     *
     * @brief Applies a set of level dependent rounded exponential (roex)
     * filters to an input power spectrum to estimate the auditory
     * representation (excitation pattern). 
     *
     * Roex filters are spaced uniformly at intervals of camStep between 1.8 and
     * 38.9.
     *
     * A lookup table is employed for the computing the rounded exponential
     * filter.
     *
     * This implementation follows a combination of:
     *
     * Glasberg, B. R., & Moore, B. C. J. (1990).  Derivation of Auditory Filter
     * Shapes From Notched-Noise Data.  Hearing Research, 47, 103â€“138.
     *

     * Steady Sounds.
