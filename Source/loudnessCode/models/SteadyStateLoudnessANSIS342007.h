    /**
     * @brief Implementation of the ANSI S3.4 2007 steady-state loudness model.
     * 
     * This loudness model is for processing spectra only, i.e., there is no
     * time-frequency decomposition. The input SignalBank can have
     * multiple ears and channels but only one sample per channel which
     * specifies the intensity of a single component. Make sure that the centre
     * frequencies corresponding to each input component are set.
     *
     * It should be noted that this model makes use of polynomials to
     * approximate the variables involved in the specific loudness calculations,
     * rather than interpolation as used in the standard. See AuditoryTools to
     * see how the specific loudness parameters are computed.
     *

     * Steady Sounds.
