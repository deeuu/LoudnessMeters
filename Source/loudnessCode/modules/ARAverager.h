    /**
     * @class ARAverager
     *
     * @brief Implements a first-order low-pass filter with seperate attack and
     * release time-constants. This module will filter all signals in the input
     * SignalBank independently and therefore gives an output SignalBank of the
     * same shape.
     *
     * The time-step used in the calculation of filter coefficients is derived
     * from the input SignalBank's frame rate, which by default is equal to the
     * sampling frequency.
