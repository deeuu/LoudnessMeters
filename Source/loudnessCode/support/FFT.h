    /**
     * @class FFT
     * @brief Computes the power spectrum of an input SignalBank.  
     *
     * A multi-resolution power spectrum can be obtained by constructing the
     * object with a vector of non-overlapping frequency bands and a vector of
     * window lengths corresponding to each band. The band edges should be
     * specified in Hz and the window sizes in in seconds.
     *
     * For example:
     *  RealVec bandFreqs{20, 100, 500};
     *  RealVec windowSpec{0.064, 0.032};
     *  FFT object(bandFreqs, windowSpec, true)
     *
     * Will construct a FFT object which uses a 64ms window for all
     * frequency bins in the interval [20, 100) and a 32ms window for all bins
     * in the interval [100, 500). Thus the input SignalBank should hold a 64ms
     * frames worth of input samples. The windows are all time-aligned at their
     * centre points. The booleon argument corresponds to whether uniform
     * spectral sampling is used (default is true). If uniform is false, the per
     * band spectrum is sampled non-uniformly at intervals corresponding to
     * fs/windowSize. Casual zero padding is applied when the internally
     * calculated FFT size is greater than the window size (powers of two).
     *
     * In the current implementation, a Hann window is applied to all segments
     * and both DC and Nyquist are not computed.
     *
     * Each spectrum is scaled such that the sum of component powers in a given
     * band equals the average power in that band (see
     * http://www.dadisp.com/webhelp/dsphelp.htm#mergedprojects/refman2/SPLGROUP/POWSPEC.htm).
     *
     * @todo Develop window class to allow for more functions.
