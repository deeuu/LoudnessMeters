     * @brief Applies a bank of double roex filters to an input power spectrum.
     *
     * This is an implementation of the double roex filter model proposed by
     * Chen et al (2011). The model makes use of a passive wideband filter and
     * an active narrowband filter.  The output of the passive filter controls
     * the active gain of the narrowband filter.
